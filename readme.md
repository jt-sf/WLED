# This is a fork of  WLED from Aircoookie with modifications for the Olimex ESP32-PoE Board

It has been modified to use an older Adafruit OLED 0.96" screen and the corresponding library and also use up to 4 DS18B20 OneWire temperature sensors on en OLIMEX ESP32-PoE-ISO board.

The original project can be found here: https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED

**Below is the original readme from the WLED project.**

------

A fast and feature-rich implementation of an ESP8266/ESP32 webserver to control NeoPixel (WS2812B, WS2811, SK6812) LEDs or also SPI based chipsets like the WS2801 and APA102!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- WS2812FX library integrated for over 100 special effects  
- FastLED noise effects and 50 palettes  
- Modern UI with color, effect and segment controls  
- Segments to set different effects and colors to parts of the LEDs  
- Settings page - configuration over network  
- Access Point and station mode - automatic failsafe AP  
- Support for RGBW strips  
- Up to 250 user presets to save and load colors/effects easily, supports cycling through them.  
- Presets can be used to automatically execute API calls  
- Nightlight function (gradually dims down)  
- Full OTA software updatability (HTTP + ArduinoOTA), password protectable  
- Configurable analog clock + support for the Cronixie kit by Diamex  
- Configurable Auto Brightness limit for safer operation  
- Filesystem-based config for easier backup of presets and settings  

## üí° Supported light control interfaces
- WLED app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aircoookie.WLED) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wled/id1475695033)
- JSON and HTTP request APIs  
- MQTT  
- Blynk IoT  
- E1.31, Art-Net, DDP and TPM2.net
- [diyHue](https://github.com/diyhue/diyHue) (Wled is supported by diyHue, including Hue Sync Entertainment under udp. Thanks to [Gregory Mallios](https://github.com/gmallios))
- [Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng)
- UDP realtime  
- Alexa voice control (including dimming and color)  
- Sync to Philips hue lights  
- Adalight (PC ambilight via serial) and TPM2  
- Sync color of multiple WLED devices (UDP notifier)  
- Infrared remotes (24-key RGB, receiver required)  
- Simple timers/schedules (time from NTP, timezones/DST supported)

## üíæ Compatible LED Strips
Type | Voltage | Comments
|---|---|---|
WS2812B | 5v |
WS2813 | 5v | 
SK6812 | 5v | RGBW
APA102 | 5v | C/D
WS2801 | 5v | C/D
LPD8806 | 5v | C/D
TM1814 | 12v | RGBW
WS2811 | 12v | 3-LED segments
WS2815 | 12v | 
GS8208 | 12v |
Analog/non-addressable | any | Requires additional circuitry

## üßä Compatible PC RGB Fans and ARGB accessories
Brand | Model | Comments
|---|---|---|
Corsair | HD120 Fan | Uses WS2812B, data-in only
PCCOOLER | Moonlight 5-pack Fans | Uses WS2812B, includes Data-out connector to keep each fan uniquely addressable if wired in series like traditional LED strips
Any | 5v 3-pin ARGB for PC | Any PC RGB device that supports the 5v 3-pin ARGB motherboard header should work fine with WLED. All the major motherboard vendors support the Corsair HD120 and PCCOOLER fans listed, so we can safely assume any device that supports motherboard ARGB 5V 3-Pin standard will work with WLED.
